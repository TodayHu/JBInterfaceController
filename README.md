JBInterfaceController
=====================

By [Mike Swanson](http://blog.mikeswanson.com/)

JBInterfaceController is a WKInterfaceController subclass that makes it easier to manage interface controllers with WatchKit.

Until I have time to write some documentation (gotta get my WatchKit app released), please take a look at the example project and header files.

## Requirements

Because JBInterfaceController is based on WatchKit, it requires iOS 8.2 or later.
